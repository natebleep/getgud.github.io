This lab8 folder contains four programs written in four different programming languages. C++, Perl, Python, and Ruby.
This file will provide information on the programs and how to run them.



C++

In the c++ folder, you will see a folder named tictactoe where the program files are kept.
The file called tic is the compiled tictactoe program.

This program is a tictactoe game in which two players take turns choosing a number corresponding to a place on a tictactoe board.

To run the program, simply run the executable 'tic' file. If this doesn't work you will have to compile the program by using the program g++ from the build-essential package that can be installed. Simply run $ sudo g++ tictactoemain.cpp and then the newly created file a.out to start the program.
